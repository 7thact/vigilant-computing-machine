                Hi. I'm originially from the East Coast, but have lived in Denver, CO for the past 3 years. I love
                everything Colorado has to offer. Recently, I have started studying web developement. At times it's
                frustrating, but I'm confident I will be successful.

            </p>

                In my free time, I like to spend time with friends and explore different neighborhoods in Denver. 
                I also enjoy checking out breweries, trying new foods, and a good cup of coffee. 
                Recently, I joined an axe throwing league. It's a lot of fun!
            </p>

                My first few jobs were in retail and coffee shops. Since arriving in Colorado, I have worked 
                in Finance sales and collections. Currently, I am a Collections Specialist for a Fintech company.
                It's a great company, but I've decided to take my career in a different direction. Hence, web developement!
